1.We have written java code to extract tweets using Twitter Streaming API
2.We have used some twitter libraries to get the tweets
3.After receiving the tweets, we have extracted the hashtags and url's for each tweet
4.We had extracted 2000 tweets (This can be customized in the code)
5.we had used hashtag #chelseaBarca as it is trending one
6.The final output of the code is the extraction of hashtags and url's which was exported to final_extraction.txt file.
The output path is mentioned in the code.
7.There is a folder "GetTwitterData", This is a java code and implemented in eclipse
8.Wordcount output and Logs of Hadoop files are located in output_hadoop and logs_hadoop folders respectively
9.Wordcount output and Logs of Spark files are located in output_spark and logs_spark folders respectively
10.The extracted hashtags and url's of java output is given as an input to hadoop and spark. This file is located in input

11.Also there are 2 jar files in lib folder of GetTwitterData. These should be required while running the code.
